Hysteresis.m is the function used to investigate hysteresis effects in the model resulting from changing the collective cooperation threshold T over time. Run the function by specifying the two parameters g=disease transmission rate and r=recovery rate in Hysteresis(g,r). To reproduce Figure 4 in the manuscript use g=0.2 and r=1/14, i.e. run Hysteresis(0.2,1/14).
